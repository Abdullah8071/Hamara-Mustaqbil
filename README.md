# Hamara-Mustaqbil 
Hamara Mustaqbil is a non-profit NGO, initiated by some students of Dow Medical College, that strives towards both the education and holistic development of our youth, primarily focusing on the underprivileged. Our primary aim is to take the underprivileged children of Pakistan, those who were never given a decent chance at life, and arm them with the necessary tools that can pave their road to a better tomorrow. Our secondary aim is to approach different schools of Pakistan with entire modules dedicated to conducting lectures and activities regarding the development of a student outside of conventional education.
